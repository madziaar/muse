# Getting Started with Riffusion Muse

Welcome! This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first song concept with Riffusion Muse. We'll cover the recommended guided workflow and the manual workflow.

## The Recommended Workflow: The Creative Assistant

The easiest and most powerful way to start is by using the **Creative Assistant**. It's an AI partner that guides you through the entire process.

### Step 1: Start the Conversation
- Navigate to the **Creative Assistant** tab.
- The AI will greet you and ask for your initial musical idea.

### Step 2: Describe Your Idea
- Type a simple description of the song you want to create. It can be anything from "a happy folk song about a sunny day" to "an epic, cinematic score for a space battle."

### Step 3: Refine Your Concept
- The AI will ask you a series of clarifying questions about the **genre**, **mood**, **instrumentation**, and **structure** of your song.
- After each question, it will provide several **clickable suggestions**. You can either click a suggestion or type your own custom response. This collaborative process helps you build a detailed and coherent musical concept.

### Step 4: Finalize and Generate
- Once the AI has gathered enough information, it will present a summary of your complete song concept for your approval.
- When you're happy with it, the AI will signal that the process is complete. Click the **"Generate & Send to Muse"** button.

### Step 5: Review in the Muse Tab
- The application will automatically switch you to the **Muse** tab.
- Here, you'll see all the fully generated assets: the Riffusion Prompt (tags), the Lyrics or Instrumental Guide, the Song Structure, and the technical Parameters.
- From here, you can copy the assets to use in Riffusion or use the "Refine" feature for any final tweaks.

## The Manual Workflow: The Muse Tab

If you already have a clear idea and want to jump straight to generation, you can use the **Muse** tab directly.

### Step 1: Enter Your Idea
- Go to the **Muse** tab.
- Type your detailed musical idea into the main prompt box. The more descriptive you are, the better the result will be.

### Step 2: Choose Your Generation Mode
- Use the toggle to select whether you want the AI to generate **Lyrics** for a song with vocals or an **Instrumental Guide** for a piece without vocals.

### Step 3: Select a Structure (Optional)
- You can provide the AI with a specific structure by choosing one of the **Structure Templates**. This is a great way to guide the overall arrangement of the song.

### Step 4: Generate
- Click the **"Generate"** button.
- The AI will process your inputs and display the four main creative assets in the result cards on the right.

### Step 5: Copy and Use
- Use the copy buttons on each card, or the "Copy All" button, to transfer the generated assets to your Riffusion workflow.
